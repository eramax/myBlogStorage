Embedding Rust in Node can be useful for many reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Raw performance</p></li><li><p>Threads and parallel programming</p></li><li><p>Access to Rust\u2019s package ecosystem</p></li><li><p>Access to native OS-specific libraries</p></li></ul><p>Neon also works hard to make creating native modules easy, with a convenient command-line interface and workflow built around sensible project conventions. This eliminates a lot of the usual hassle of building native Node modules.</p>","title":"Neon - Electrify your Node with the power of Rust!","slug":"neon-electrify-your-node-with-the-power-of-rust-hmgh"}
