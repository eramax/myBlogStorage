Use \nit for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the\n final site.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons for using this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AJAX requests don't work with the <code>file://</code> protocol due to security restrictions, i.e. you need a server if your site fetches content through JavaScript.</li>\n<li>Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate development.</li>\n</ol><h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>You need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g live-server\n</code></pre><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tapio/live-server\">https://github.com/tapio/live-server</a></p>","title":"Localhost HTML Live Server with hot loading","slug":"localhost-html-live-server-with-hot-loadingzmda"}
